## LaTeX

Recently, I had the great fortune of learning to use LaTeX. As in intern in the UofL Bioinformatics lab, I was to typeset and format the paper with this archane yet functional [LaTeX template](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/submission_online). Things were going very well, I had a symbols cheat sheet and cranked out some beautiful pseudocode, just like the _real_ achademics. I was using an online editor for easy sharing, but was preparing to switch to editing locally so I could unleash the power of Vim.  
The typesetting was so nice looking, and the document was very easy to manage. Nothing was buggy or confusing, any time the wasn't productivity was spent learning skills that apply across many different situations. Best of all, it was all in plaintext so I could edit on any computer and only had to worry about setting up software to compile it, which I was cheating out of by doing it in the browser.

## Tragedy

All good things must come to an end. Some of the journals we publishing to required word files. How achademic publishing works is beyond me, but we had no choice but to convert back to the land of proprietary software. I tried some converters but the results were dismal and left the citations broken. I finally copied the markup into plain text and parsed it by hand, filling in special characters, converting formulas, inserting images. The work that was so wonderfully done once and for all by a few keystrokes now took endless clicking though bars and menus, which were bound to change in the next "update."  
References and citations that were once managed by simple text tags now took on the form of mysterious connections whos inner workings were only privy to dialog boxes and further layers of proprietary software. Figures no longer floated to where they should be based on well defined contraints, instead they had to be dragged into place and required tweaking to their properties to behave nicely with the text around them.  
The next resume I write will have the line "Incapable of using Microsoft products," for my own well being.
