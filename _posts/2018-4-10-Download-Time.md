I downloaded and cleaned all of the files from [Mighty Optical Illusions](https://www.moillusions.com/4-dots-illusion/)  and [ViperLib](http://viperlib.york.ac.uk/) into JPEG (.jpg) images. They are available for download from <https://www.floydhub.com/robertmax/datasets/optical-illusions> and the source files and build process can be found on <https://github.com/robertmaxwilliams/optical-illusion-dataset>.

In the meantime I made an experiment trying to train a GAN on all of image, and a classifier. Both failed in different ways

TODO include confusion matrix and GAN trash
