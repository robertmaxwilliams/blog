## [Mighty Optical Illusions](https://www.moillusions.com/4-dots-illusion/)
To obtain images, I started at this page <https://www.moillusions.com/one-two-face-illusion/>. I used python's Beuatiful Soup library to copy all image links and then follow the previous button to the next page, and repeated until I was out of next pages. This leads to a grand total of **6436 image**. It's hard to know how many are duds, but that is a good start.
